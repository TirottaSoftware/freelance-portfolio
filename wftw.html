    <section id="problem">
      <div class="page-width">
        <h2>
          Have you ever stared at a blank artboard trying to come up with design
          ideas?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I know how it feels to spend hours looking at a blank page without
          taking action. In fact, I’ve wasted so much time on it that I came up
          with a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          After hours and hours spent staring at an empty artboard, I slowly
          started noticing that the problem is not going to get fixed by itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I started researching the “Blank Page Syndrome” in more depth,
          trying to find a solution once and for all.
        </p>
        <p>Turns out that the whole issue is caused by lack of structure.</p>
        <p>
          Most people starting out in UI & UX are desperately trying to come up
          with high-fidelity design ideas without even understanding the
          structure behind it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And they waste hours and hours in front of the blank page just like I
          did.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later on, they zoom out to see the bigger picture, and they realize
          that the actual high-fidelity design is among the last stages in the
          process.
        </p>
        <p>
          So they go back to the basics, starting from sketching, user research,
          etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then they get to the stage I believe is the core part of the whole
          design process.
        </p>
        <p>And it can make or break your design.</p>
        <p>
          Once i realized it, I started spending more time on that phase alone
          than on all <u>other design phases combined.</u>
        </p>
        <p>And that crucial stage I am talking about is</p>
        <h2 class="col-brand uppercase">Wireframing</h2>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="story" class="bg-grey">
      <div class="page-width">
        <p>Einstein said it best:</p>
        <p class="sq">
          “If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking
          about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions.”
        </p>
        <p>
          So why not spend at least 50% of your time thinking about the project
          structure and putting some work on the wireframes
        </p>
        <p>
          As I said, wireframes can make or break your design, and they are a
          vital part of the design process
        </p>
        <p>So why not give a 100% when working on them?</p>
        <p class="col-dark"><b>Now, here’s the deal breaker:</b></p>
        <p>
          I’ve spent countless hours staring at a blank canvas, sketching,
          wireframing, and learning about the design process in depth.
        </p>
        <p>And honestly, it was a nightmare.</p>
        <p>
          All these hours could’ve been invested into design practice, or into
          progressing as a designer, instead of just learning how to create
          quality wireframes.
        </p>
        <p>Don’t get me wrong, I am grateful for coming this far.</p>
        <p>
          However, you have the chance to get this far way sooner than I did.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without having to waste time figuring out where to find the
          information you’re looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did my best to summarize all the lessons I’ve learned about
          wireframing in a single e-book.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I chose Wireframing as a topic simply because it took me so much
          time to get the hang of it.
        </p>
        <p>And because of its importance in the design process.</p>
